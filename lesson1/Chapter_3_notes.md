# **Chapter 3 Decision Structures**
## **3.1 The if Statement**
The if statement is used to create a decision structure, which allows a program to have more than one path of execution. The if statement causes one or more statement to execute only when a boolean expression is true.

sequence structure - statements are executed in sequence, without branching off in another direction.

In a decision structure's simples form, a specific action is taken only when a condition exists. If the condition does not exist, the action is not performed.

A relational operator determines whether a specific relationship exists between two values.

Indentions and spacing are for the human readers of a program, not the compiler.

You do not put a semicolon after the if (expression) portion of an if statement.

This is because the if statement isn't complete without its conditionally executed statement.

If you prematurely terminate an if statement with a semicolon, the compiler will not display an error message, but will assume that you are placing a null statement there.

The if statement can also conditionally execute a group of statements, as long as they are enclosed in a set of braces. Enclosing a group of statements inside braces creates a block of statements.

## **3.2 The if-else Statement**
The if-else statement will execute one group of statements if its boolean expression is true, or another group if its boolean expression is false.
