# **Chapter 6 - A First Look at Classes**

## **6.1 - Objects and Classes**
An object is a software component that exists in memory and serves a specific purpose in a program.
An object is created from a class that contains code describing the object.

Most programming languages in use today are object-oriented. With an object-oriented language, such as Java, you create programs that are made of objects.

In software, an object has two general capabilities:
* An object can store data. The data stored in an object are commonly called *fields*.
* An object can perform operations. The operations that an object can perform are called *methods*.

A *class* is code that describes a particular type of object.
It specifies the data that an object can hold (the object's fields), and the actions that an object can perform (the object's methods).

A class is not an object, but a description of an object.
Each object that is created from a class is called an *instance* of the class.

When you are working with an object, you are typically using tow things:
* The object itself, which must be created in memory.
* A reference variable that refers to the object.

Creating an object typically requires the following two steps:
1. You declare a reference variable.
2. You create the object in memory, and assign its memory address to the reference variable.

## **6.2 - Writing a Simple Class, Step by Step**
You can write your own classes to create the objects that you need in a program.
