# **Lesson 6 Lab Notes**

Write a program that reads U.S. state education data from a file into an array of objects of class **StateEducationData**, provided for you.
You will then display statistics of the data, including averages, the state with the highest high school completion rate, etc.

The file **StateEducationData.txt** will contain data for exactly ten states.
You may not assume what state data in the file, but you may assume that the file has the format described below.
The file contains data for exactly ten states, ordered as **name**, **high school completion percentage**, **college completion percentage**, and **advanced degree completion percentage**.
You do not need to validate the dta in the file. You may assume ten complete records of the correct data types.

The program will display a list of all of the states in the file with the percentage of individuals who completed high school, etc.
It will list the state with the largest high school completion percentage, the lowest high school completion percentage, and it will display the average high school completion percentage.
